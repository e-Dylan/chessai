Autoplaying chess deeplearning bot to play against real players in online chess

## TO DO:

- detect piece colors

- handle pawn promotion in move uci strings ('a7a8' -> 'a7a8q' when a pawn)

- serialize all square indices to a class field on Square class init to be accessible at any time (and not have to re-call a function every time to get its indices by coords)
